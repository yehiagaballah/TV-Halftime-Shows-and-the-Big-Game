# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game

Hello,

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected.

This code analyzes a data set of Half time shows shown on TV during big games like the super bowl. How adverisements and shows are targetting audience at these times and how this is done.
